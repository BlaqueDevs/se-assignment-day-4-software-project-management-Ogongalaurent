## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile vs. Waterfall: Key Differences
Agile is flexible, iterative, and involves continuous feedback, making it ideal for evolving projects.
Waterfall is structured, sequential, and best for projects with fixed requirements.
Advantages & Disadvantages
Advantages of Agile: Adaptable, faster delivery, continuous testing, client involvement.
Disadvantages of Agile: Hard to predict timelines, scope creep risk, requires skilled teams.
Advantages of Waterfall: Clear structure, predictable cost/timeline, minimal client involvement needed.
Disadvantages of Waterfall: Rigid, difficult to change, delayed testing and feedback.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile vs. Waterfall: Best Use Cases
Agile is ideal for flexible, evolving projects with frequent updates and user feedback.
Examples:
Software startups
Mobile apps
E-commerce platforms
AI & game development
Waterfall works best for structured projects with fixed requirements and strict regulations.
Examples:
Construction projects
Banking & financial software
Government & defense projects
Medical device software
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality Assurance in Software Projects
Key Methods:
Clear requirements & planning
Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, UAT)
Automated testing & CI/CD
Code reviews & defect tracking
Performance & security testing
User feedback & beta testing
Documentation & quality audits

Why Itâ€™s Important:
Ensures reliability & security
Reduces costs & rework
Enhances performance & user satisfaction
Maintains compliance & company reputation
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining Project Scope Helps By:
-Setting clear objectives & expectations
-Preventing scope creep & managing risks
-Improving resource allocation & stakeholder alignment

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
A hierarchical breakdown of tasks that improves planning, tracking, and resource management.

Why WBS is Useful:
-Organizes work clearly
-Enhances time & cost estimation
-Improves team coordination & risk management
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule:
-Improves time management & resource allocation
-Identifies risks & dependencies
-Enhances team coordination & stakeholder communication
-Increases chances of on-time completion

How Gantt Charts Help:
-Provide a visual timeline of tasks & deadlines
-Track progress & manage dependencies
-Facilitate adjustments & improve collaboration
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Price Comprison Software
Core Issues Addressed:
-Price variability across stores
-Time-consuming manual searches
-Hidden costs & misleading discounts
-Lack of real-time price updates

Why It Matters:
-Saves Money & Time â€“ Finds the lowest prices instantly
-Ensures Transparency â€“ Shows total costs, including shipping
-Helps Catch Real Deals â€“ Filters out fake discounts
-Empowers Smart Shopping â€“ Provides data for informed decisions
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem ensures focus, accurate requirements, and a targeted solution, preventing scope creep and wasted resources. It helps in selecting the right technology, facilitates testing, and improves team collaboration, leading to an effective software solution.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
Our software is a smart shopping assistant that automatically compares prices across multiple online stores and finds the cheapest option for you. It saves time, money, and effort by providing real-time updates and filtering out misleading discounts, ensuring you always get the best deal with complete transparency.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
-Real-Time Price Comparison â€“ Instantly scans multiple online stores to find the lowest price.
-Smart Filtering & Sorting â€“ Allows users to filter by price, brand, ratings, shipping costs, and more.
-Hidden Cost Transparency â€“ Displays total costs, including shipping and taxes, for accurate comparisons.
-Deal & Discount Verification â€“ Identifies genuine discounts and flags misleading price hikes.
-Price Drop Alerts â€“ Notifies users when prices drop on their favorite products.
-User Reviews & Ratings Integration â€“ Helps shoppers make informed decisions based on real customer feedback.
-Browser Extension & Mobile App â€“ Enables seamless price comparisons while browsing online stores.
-AI-Powered Recommendations â€“ Suggests better deals and alternative products based on user preferences.
Why It Stands Out
-Unlike basic comparison tools, our software provides real-time, accurate, and transparent price insights, helping users make smart, money-saving shopping decisions effortlessly.
